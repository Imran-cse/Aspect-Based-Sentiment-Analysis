i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
"there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box ."
just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
"after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! "
"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &"
38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . 
"i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition . "
"my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared . "
"the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . "
"the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . "
"the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it . "
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
"after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . "
"i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl . "
"here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . "
"it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! "
"i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable . "
"also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious . "
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
"the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . "
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
"however , it serves its purpose ."
"the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- "
i checked with nokia .
"the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . "
"the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . "
more downside to this phone ? 
the volume .
oh my goodness -- 
forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person ! 
"on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . "
"i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . "
i was surprised by t-mobile 's service . 
"i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . "
reason ? 
they piggy-back on cingular 's service . 
"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . "
"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" . "
"i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked . "
24 hours ? 
by what time standards -- martian ? 
"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands ."
"also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out . "
"in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . "
"but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you . "
"i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me : "
"""when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr : "
""" i 'm not sure "" . ) . "
"umm , well , thanks for nothing ."
"this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. . "
that was annoying .
"mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's ."
"however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . "
and no t-zones .
so what 's the point ? 
"i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . "
i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services . 
guess all that glitters is not gold . 
it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out . 
hope someone else has better luck ! 
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile . 
recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine . 
"disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone . "
two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order . 
"while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . "
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 . 
"i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down . "
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
"from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . "
"whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . "
"wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker ! "
i have had this phone for about 5 months .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
"at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days . "
it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls . 
signal strength will affect the battery life . 
frequent signal searches eat up battery power . 
"i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover . "
i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at . 
the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
"some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . "
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
the vibration is not top . 
"it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in . "
"i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it . "
vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
so it was no loss . 
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
"great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . "
i do hope that they offer more faceplate options . 
i am bored with the silver look . 
it has a nice color screen .
it is small . 
"radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in ."
"that is a major minus , but its not that bad ."
mobile was a pretty good server .
it has 2 games . 
they are not wowable good .
you have to buy better ones . 
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
"this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it . "
nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon . 
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store . 
"when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : "
it defaulted to unchangeable email . 
"so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem . "
"i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't . "
"he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail . "
"so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours . "
"while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . "
"negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . "
poor visibility on the keys .
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
the title says it all ... 
"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... "
only con i can think of is no camera ... . 
no big deal for the size . 
this phone is a winner …
"anything this phone does , it does perfectly . "
"the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly ."
the speakerphone :
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
as said before this works perfectly .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
"only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . "
the radio :
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
"this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . "
tri-band :
"one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia . "
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
"if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe . "
sold in other parts of the world : 
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
"or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe . "
i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service . 
able to use service in another country : 
"if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country . "
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country . 
size and weight : 
"when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . "
"this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . "
battery life : 
the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
"it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby . "
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
"this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . "
"the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . "
"overall , i highly recommend this phone . "
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go : 
pros :
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . 
"sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . "
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
"surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . "
cons : 
"ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . "
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . 
nice little phone ... light compact . . 
great features . . 
buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. 
"perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest . "
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform . 
"i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device . "
"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . "
the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
"i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service . "
i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
"the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . "
"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead . "
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle . 
"the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . "
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
"the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . "
thumbs down on that one . 
the vibrate setting is loud ! 
"so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . "
"but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . "
"which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone …"
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
"i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ... "
pros : 
"light , compact design "
"solid , high-quality construction "
 well-backlit keypad 
outstanding signal reception
excellent sound quality 
"bright , visible screen "
speakerphone 
very long-lasting battery life
cons : 
some features in the user interface
no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking 
no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . 
no propietary headset jack 
this bumpy is wicked groovy .

aight den bumpy ? 
word ... peace in the east bruvah . 
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 
i like the speakphone function a lot .
it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs . 
i like the automatic key lock function . 
the phone is very light weight . 
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
the fm radio is cool . 
most of our emplyees use this model phone .
best regards sadoun satellite sales 
"while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . "
"after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 ."
and really this is the best phone one could have .
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 
"it is lightweight , sleek and attractive ."
"this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . "
the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only . 
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime . 
"its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside ."
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
only if we could get one camera in it . . 
it did have scored over all other competitors ....
i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 
"like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program . "
"i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me . "
pros : 
small size . 
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
just make sure the keys are locked . 
color screen is good . 
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
"navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . "
"battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . "
cons : 
not many .
"the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . "
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
please !
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) . 
my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone . 
below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends : 
sound quality : 
the most important thing for me is sound quality .
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
"i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series . "
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . 
overall design : 
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest . 
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys . 
ease of use : 
how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) . 
that is a very nice feature .
"the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) . "
"the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use . "
battery : 
"the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much . "
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) . 
features : 
the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice . 
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity . 
"the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use ."
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
"it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . "
"the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla . "
"all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready . "
"in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones . "
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft . 
oh well .. 
overall this is a slightly better than average phone . 
both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 . 
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more . 
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year . 
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 . 
"they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling . "
this is the best phone i have seen . 
i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend . 
we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons . 
the phones are awesome .
"we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . "
here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
